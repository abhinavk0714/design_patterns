# Design Patterns

In this project, I implemented a variety of design patterns in Java!

## Technologies & Frameworks

- **Java** - Programming language used for implementing design patterns
- **JDK 18+** - Java Development Kit version 18 or higher

## Design Patterns Implemented
- **Decorator** - Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically
- **Iterator** - Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
- **Observer** - Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
- **Singleton** - Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it
- **State** - Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class
- **Strategy** - Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable

## Usage

To run and test the design patterns:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhinavk0714/design_patterns.git
   cd design_patterns
   
2. Compile and Run the Examples:

- Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
- Navigate to the design pattern you want to test.
- Locate the main method in the example classes for the specific pattern.
- Run the main method to see the design pattern in action.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional design patterns to add, feel free to open a pull request.
